        - Built a car with sensors that follows black colored line (example: tape) <br /><br />
        - The movement of the car can be controlled through sound sensors <br /><br />
        - For example: one clap to stop the car and two claps to resume the movement of the car <br /><br />
        - 3 QTI sensors used to detect left, right and forward movement<br /><br />
        - Used Arduino microcontrollers to program the QTI and sound sensors<br /><br />
        - Learned how hardware interacts with software<br/>
